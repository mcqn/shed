# Shed

The place where you keep random tools and things that might come in useful one day

 * [serial-logger.rb](serial-logger.rb) - simple script to capture serial output and print it to stdout
 * [gcode-max-min.py](gcode-max-min.py) - script to take a GCode file and output GCode to draw the bounding box (ignores the z-axis at present, doesn't output any feedrate)
